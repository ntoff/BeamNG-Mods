mods for bem en gee

This is where I put stuff for beamng. 

This may not be the most end-user friendly way to store mods for beamng, but it isn't meant to be, it's for tracking changes to files.

If you're here looking for the mods, just clone this directory someplace, or download the zip file & extract whichever mod you're after.
