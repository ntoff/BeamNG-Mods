# Rock Madness

* What is? Makes with the spawning and the following and the raining and the destruction
* How do? Add the rock madness UI app, push button, receive rock madness
* Why tho? Because chaos
* Safe tho? Probably not. Use at your own risk. It hasn't melted my PC, no guarantee it won't melt yours.
* How configure? Can't. Unless you want to edit the rockMadness.lua file (in which case, can). Config via ui app not a thing (yet? ever? never?)
* Why's it limited to 40 rocks in the UI app? Because 40 is heaps. You can manually spawn more if you want, but the more rocks the worse the performance, and the longer the wait for them to spawn.

*Note: When spawning rocks, especially large amounts, beamng may appear to freeze. Just leave it. It's doing the same thing it does when it spawns AI vehicles (it thinks the rocks are cars)*

*Noteus Note the 2nd: Beam might tell you you can tab to the other "cars", it lies. Switching to the rocks is forbidden, you can't drive them anyway.*

*Note the three: When removing the rocks with the delete button, it just removes anything with the matching rock jbeam. If you've manually placed some rocks on the map, it'll probably take those with it*
